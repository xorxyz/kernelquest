Unlike traditional cybersecurity training that is often passive, XOR aims to train users the way the most elite hackers train, by leveraging computer security "Capture the Flag" (CTF) contests. CTFs offer a radically new approach to cybersecurity training and simulation by gamifying training in a way that keeps contestants engaged while imparting real skills.

With online and live in-person versions, XOR is designed to train people with a wide range of technical knowledge in actionable cybersecurity skills. Individuals can play alone or as part of a team in a competition, scoring points in a range of problems across the following areas:

- Binary Exploitation 
- Reverse Engineering 
- Web Exploitation 
- Forensics 
- Cryptography
