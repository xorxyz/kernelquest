extra notes:

- When players ask for hints, a lot of times itâ€™s to verify they are on the right track. Giving them proper feedback cuts down your hinting and increases their satisfaction of solving the puzzle themselves.
- Finding the initial set of mechanics that will support an entire puzzle game is tricky: they must be rich enough in possibility to be recombined in new and interesting ways, but they cannot be so complex that they create a chaos from which no singular solution can be intuited.
- Ideally, you want the player to spend the most time thinking about a puzzle, and as little time as possible to input that solution into the puzzle to see if it works as intended. This is why puzzles should be in their smallest solvable setup, to make it easier to interpret and understand the puzzle. 
- Solving challenges gives you experience points.
- Experience points give you levels.
- Levels give you ability and skill points.
- Abilities points can be used to ugrade abilities.
- Skill points can be used to ugrade skills.
