subtitle: xor is a computer security MUD
---

You take control of a computer process, which you can use to explore hypervisors and interact with an operating system simulation. Bots give you missions to complete. Missions involve solving computer security puzzles, which reward you with in-game currency. You can then use that currency to upgrade your userspace and unlock different tools, or trade with each other players.

Except it's set in a medieval world, and computing is a magical algebra.
