  <p>
    information is encoded in matter. matter is not created nor destroyed.
    this means that if you need values, you'll need to either find them in the wild or take ownership of a data cell and write a value into it.
    litteral values can be invoked in the local program,
    but they don't persist unless they are stored in a data cell.
    they are lost if they are popped off the stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    every data cell has a stack. 
    writing to a cell rewrites the whole cell stack.
    popping a ref off the stack drops it on the floor.
    dropping a ref on the floor pushes it to the cell's stack.
    dying pops the whole stack, discarding unsaved values and dropping refs on the floor. 
  </p>

  <p>
    refs can be stored in and loaded from the inventory.
    <pre><code>
    &ref(x,y) (@a) store -> (void)
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code>
    (@a) load -> &ref(x,y)
    </code></pre>

    peek() prints the value of the ref on the top of the stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    digging in a given direction returns a ref to that cell.
    holding a ref gives you ownership over the cell it points to.
    <pre><code>
    (direction) dig -> maybe(err, ref)
    </code></pre>
    
    reading from a ref returns the value stored in the referenced cell.
    <pre><code>
    (ref) read -> (value)
    </code></pre>
    
    writing a value to a ref returns void.
    <pre><code>
    (ref) (value) write -> (void)
    </code></pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    cells that have been dug cannot be walked on.
