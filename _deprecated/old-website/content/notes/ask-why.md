The underlying concept as applied to game design is that game mechanisms are embedded in a larger world. Players explore that larger world as they explore the game mechanisms. Rather than layer a story on top, the story is also woven into the space that the player is exploring. As the player explores the world through the mechanisms, they are also exploring the story. It is the player’s actions that advance the story, and the player understands the story through engaging with the game design. This concept of environmental storytelling creates a more immersive narrative experience than presenting the story as a layer
on top of the game world and mechanisms (Jenkins, 2004). 

> “Why is this here?” 

Something that would normally not be in the setting or the world can be there because it is something a character in the story or even the players themselves would bring into the space because of the role they are playing.

three things that audiences want from storytellers:

1. take me to a place i've never been
2. make me into someone i could never be
3. let me do things i could never do

With a one-hour playtime, escape games don’t have the time to explore an in-depth backstory

The best solution is to reveal backstory through exposition brought to light during the action of an ongoing story

By exposing the players to the backstory through the challenges, then this content can be delivered in small pieces instead of putting it all into a lengthy pre-game narrative

Each story beat can then be conveyed as part of a challenge.

having the story broken into smaller pieces that the player can encounter in a non-linear fashion gives the player the agency to feel as in control of the gameplay experience.

By building the narrative into the environment and challenges, the designer can present clues in each activity to suggest the next possible paths of exploration. The players should have a meaningful reason for taking on a task other than “it’s the next thing to do in the room”.

For play to be meaningful, the actions a player take have to be discernable, meaning the player understands the result of what they are doing, and integrated, meaning the actions the player takes in the game make a difference. 

puzzles and tasks are not simply there to be barriers to winning the game, but each challenge has a purpose and is tied into the larger narrative, giving the player a way to find meaning in their actions.

3 ways in which a challenge can have meaning to a player: 

1. it can engage with an element of the narrative backstory that has been presented to the player
1. it can interact with the world in which the player exists 
1. it can have a direct impact on the player or other characters in the game

> “So, first try to find a way to let the player do it; your second choice is to show it. And finally, your last resort is to tell it” (Skolnick, 2014, p. 57).

as players undertake a series of quests, they develop a deeper understanding of the setting they inhabit.

to actually enter the game rooms, the players must succeed at
some type of challenge designed to get them in the mindset of the genre of the room. This initiation process helps players transition from the real world into the game world and specific setting through a challenge.

have the challenge connect to the fictional world that is outside the game space

Evidence of the larger world in the physical game space can be used to develop a narrative

the “world narrative works through the presence or absence of features in the environment which imply some situation or history”

Physical items, documents, and audio or video logs can convey recent events that have occurred in the space more effectively than a pre-game backstory 

Challenges can help the players see how that outside world is affecting their own game setting, and how what they are doing can have an effect on the outside world. 

This can also be explored with communications sent to the outside world. A common way this is done in games is with tools like Morse code machines, telephones, fax machines, or a computer (based upon the setting of the game).

Players may have to receive and decode a communication, send a reply, and then later in the game, see the effects of sending that reply.  

If the player has a quest, and to accomplish the quest, the
player must overcome conflicts, then having the player work through a challenge to acquire a tool to help with the conflict can make it more meaningful. That tool could be a physical tool, such as a magnet or a rope, or a mental tool, such as an encoding scheme or a new way of understanding something. 

Instead of having a clock that doesn’t make sense in the world, designers should consider other ways to indicate that time is passing such as an audio track, recorded messages passed on through telephones or walkie-talkies, or other in-game resources that are drained over time.

Having a surprise is one way to present the players with a new emergent narrative.
four stages in adding a surprise:

1. First, it needs to be a surprise; it needs to be something the players did not see coming. 
2. Second, it needs to be based upon something that was set up beforehand. 
3. Third, it should not be something that is highly unlikely to happen. 
4. Finally, it should make sense afterwards to the players

have multiple endings to the game based upon the players’ actions.

A puzzle is made of a number of elements, and at least one of these elements from each puzzle should lead to a meaningful engagement for a player

The context and rules for the puzzle could be delivered by one of the
characters in the game.

The resources that are used in solving the puzzle could
come from the world in which the game is set.

The strategies needed to solve the puzzle could map to something in the narrative of the game.

The solution can be part of the quest that the players are working toward. 

the existence of the puzzle in the game needs to make sense from the perspective of the genre, the setting, and the narrative.

A good puzzle allows the player to experience some frustration, but also provides checkpoints along the way so that the player knows that he or she is on the right path

create checkpoints in the puzzle where the player knows
that they have hit a state of partial completion, that they are on the right path, and that their frustration and effort will lead to a reward 

These checkpoints could serve as points of connection into some aspect of the setting or narrative.

In good challenge design, the team should be confident that their answer is the correct answer before trying it in a lock.

To create an interesting puzzle, the solver should be faced with choices and traps.

Some choices may appear to be correct, and many times, the choices that appear easy are not the correct choices 

An elegant puzzle needs to balance the requirement for effort and inspiration to solve. “Too much effort, and the puzzle is busywork. Too much inspiration, and the puzzle is a guessing game. 

Well-designed puzzles should have players moving between putting in effort to reach the next checkpoint, and then require the players to step back, think about the next path to pursue, and create those magical moments when the player figures out what to do.

create puzzles with a-ha shortcuts. If there are multiple paths to solving a puzzle, one of which is all process, but time consuming, and the other allows for some shortcuts, this can better offset the risk of using a-ha elements in puzzles

a McGuffin is something in the room that, at first, has no clear connection to the quest, but that something occurs during the game to elevate that game element to quest status

four generations of technological advancement as a way to categorize escape rooms

1. Gen 1 rooms are mostly mechanical in nature and require human engagement and human power, either of the player or the game master, to make things change in the room. 
2. Gen 2 rooms use more electronic sensors, magnetic locks, and remote controls to change elements in the room, but they are still human-triggered. 
3. Gen 3 rooms integrate technology and computer control, so that the room is able to respond to the actions of the players without human involvement. 
4. Gen 4 rooms automate the clue systems, control the flow of
players through the experience, and can change the game space based upon the performance of the players

while most of the room design should remain consistent, sometimes something needs to be adjusted away from realism to make it a more enjoyable player experience
