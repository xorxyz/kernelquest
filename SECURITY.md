# Security

## Scope

If you believe you've found a security issue in software that is maintained in this repository, please report it to me as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, please report them to the me at jonathan@diagonal.sh. If possible, encrypt your message with my PGP key; you can find the link at https://xor.xyz/.well-known/security.txt

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure I received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (*as much as you can provide*) to help me better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.

## Safe Harbor

I support safe harbor for security researchers who:

1. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of my services.
2. Provide me with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior to any disclosure to the public or a third-party.

I will consider activities conducted in line with this policy to constitute "authorized" conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement. I will help to the extent I can if legal action is initiated by a third party against you.

Please submit a report to me before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.
