- "Role-playing games provide a natural role-switching mechanism, which may help children experience different roles such as question-asker and question-answerer in group interaction. In addition, role-playing games enable children to play very different roles in games than in real life, which may enhance their competencies in problem solving (Hammer, 2007)"
- safe environment for players to experiment and explore without worrying about social risks such as failure
- collaborative learning
- design guidelines and frameworks for technology-enhanced learning environments that foster epistemic curiosity in science education
- four aspects of an ideal curiosity-evoking environment
  1. a role-playing game to encourage exploration of science concepts by allowing children to switch amongst the different roles in science exploration
  2. a virtual peer that models and scaffolds exploratory and collaborative hands-on learning in the role-playing game in ways that trigger increased curiosity on the part of the players
  3. a multimodal sensing system that automatically recognizes players learning states and conveys them to the virtual peer
  4. a set of curiosity-evoking virtual toys that allow real and virtual peers to play together
- interactive fiction
  - almost exclusively dialogue and narrative-based games
