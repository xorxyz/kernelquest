# level design

## exploitable systems and emergent design

end goals, obstacles, tools

1. define the end goal as loosely as you possibly can
2. place obstacles in the way that prevent them from getting what they want too easily
3. allow the player to tackle that obstacle in a variety of ways by manipulating the game systems given a complex set of tools
