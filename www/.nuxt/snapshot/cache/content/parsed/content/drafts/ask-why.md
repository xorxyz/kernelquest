Players explore that larger world as they explore the game mechanisms. Rather than layer a story on top, the story is also woven into the space that the player is exploring. As the player explores the world through the mechanisms, they are also exploring the story. It is the player’s actions that advance the story, and the player understands the story through engaging with the game design. This concept of environmental storytelling creates a more immersive narrative experience than presenting the story as a layer\non top of the game world and mechanisms (Jenkins, 2004)."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“Why is this here?”"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Something that would normally not be in the setting or the world can be there because it is something a character in the story or even the players themselves would bring into the space because of the role they are playing."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"three things that audiences want from storytellers:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ol","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"take me to a place i've never been"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"make me into someone i could never be"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"let me do things i could never do"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"With a one-hour playtime, escape games don’t have the time to explore an in-depth backstory"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The best solution is to reveal backstory through exposition brought to light during the action of an ongoing story"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"By exposing the players to the backstory through the challenges, then this content can be delivered in small pieces instead of putting it all into a lengthy pre-game narrative"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Each story beat can then be conveyed as part of a challenge."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"having the story broken into smaller pieces that the player can encounter in a non-linear fashion gives the player the agency to feel as in control of the gameplay experience."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"By building the narrative into the environment and challenges, the designer can present clues in each activity to suggest the next possible paths of exploration.
