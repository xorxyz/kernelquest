<h1>design of the language</h1>

<blockquote>
  one of these <a href="https://hypercubed.github.io/joy/html/synops.html">Joy</a> inspired languages.
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>simple syntax</li>
  <li>homoiconicity (code as data) </li>
  <li>self-interpreted</li>
  <li>introspection, reflection and metaprogramming</li>
  <li>simple algebra, with programs easily manipulated by hand</li>
</ul>

<h2>data structures</h2>

<ul>
  <li>literals of any type cause a value of that type to be pushed
  onto the stack</li>
  <li>lists are just special cases of quoted programs</li>
  <li>a function can consume any number of parameters from the
  stack and leave any number of results on the stack</li>
</ul>

thing:  atom | compound

## atoms

ref    ( a pointer that resolves to a cell's data. )
truth  yes y. | no n. | maybe ?. (1 byte.)
hex    00-FF ( 2 bytes. )
ascii  'a-'z 'A-'Z ( 1 byte. )
utf8   ðŸ’Ž ( 4 bytes. )
word   combinator | operator | name ( 1 utf8. )

## compounds

set      ( n unique atoms. )
list     ( n things. )
string   ( n utf8. )
stack    ( basically a list. )
program  ( n lists. )

## memory

cell   ( 1 utf8. )
port   ( ref to a neighbour cell,  n | e | s | w. )
row    ( 16 cells. )
col    ( 10 cells. )
room   ( 16 x 10 cells. )
zone   ( 16 x 10 rooms. )
world  ( set of zones. )
