<h1>design of the language</h1>

<blockquote>one of these Joy inspired languages</blockquote> 

<pre>
- simple syntax
- homoiconicity (code as data) 
- self-interpreted
- introspection, reflection and metaprogramming
</pre>

<h2>data structures</h2>

<pre>
- literals of any type cause a value of that type to be pushed onto the stack
- lists are just special cases of quoted programs
- a function can consume any number of parameters from the stack and leave any number of results on the stack

thing:  atom | compound

## atoms

ref    ( a pointer that resolves to a cell's data. )
truth  yes y. | no n. | maybe ?. (1 byte.)
hex    00-FF ( 2 bytes. )
ascii  'a-'z 'A-'Z ( 1 byte. )
utf8   ðŸ’Ž ( 4 bytes. )
word   combinator | operator | name ( 1 utf8. )

## compounds

set      n ( unique. ) asciiÂ | hex
list     n things
string   n utf8
stack    list
program  n lists

## memory

cell    1 utf8
port    ref to a neighbour cell ( n | e | s | w. )
row     16 cells
col     10 cells
matrix  w rows h cols
grid    16 rows 10 cols matrix
