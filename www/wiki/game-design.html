# design of the game

> "these kind of nuanced trade offs 
> forcing you to understand what you value
> and make a bet on that choice"

1:
- player uncovers new item or ability;
- experiments and figures out how to use that item or ability;
- uses it to solve puzzles that allow you to move onto the next stage;
- each room has one main puzzle which serves as a way to teach you how to use your new abilities

2:
- short term risk in exchange for large reward
- random parallel learning
- expectation of failure most of the time
- limit tool availability
- competing objectives

# mission?

- toys
- human-size computing
- computing from first principles
- something something faerie stories, fantasy & Tolkien

# level design

ideas should be embodied by the game mechanics, or taught through quests, or implied through the narrative.

## exploitable systems and emergent design

end goals, obstacles, tools

1. define the end goal as loosely as you possibly can
2. place obstacles in the way that prevent them from getting what they want too easily
3. allow the player to tackle that obstacle in a variety of ways by manipulating the game systems given a complex set of tools 

# quest ideas

- drudgery. as a novice wizard, you are tasked with menial magical tasks like formatting `mandoc` pages by hand.
