<h2>faerie, an enchanted realm</h2>

<p>one's unquestioned assumptions might be recovered and changed by an outside perspective.</p>

<p>fantasy allows one to review their own world from the "perspective" of a different world.</p>

<p>a world which is consistent and rational, under rules other than those of the normal world, but presented as wholly credible. an alternative world or universe as the setting for speculative fiction.</p>

<h2>themes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the interdependence of language and human consciousness.</li>
  <li>terseness: a time when consoles were teletypes, modems were slow, and memory was precious</li>
  <li>?</li>
</ul>

<h2>magic, spells & spirits</h2>

<p>
  the year is [1038].
  the year has always been 1038. or has it?
  nobody remembers.
  and what is the [epoch] loop, anyway?
</p>

<p>
  people seem to have mostly forgotten about the [Maintainers].
</p>



<p>
[apprentices] learn to understand and to anticipate the 
consequences of their [conjuring]. 

</p>

<p>
a [spirit] cannot be seen or touched.
it is not composed of matter at all.
however, it is very [real].

</p>

<p>

as [spirits] evolve, they transform matter.

</p>

<p>

the evolution of a spirit is directed by a pattern of rules 
called a [spell].

</p>

<p>

[spells] are carefully composed from [symbolic] expressions 
in arcane and [esoteric] languages. they prescribe the tasks
one wants [spirits] to perform.

</p>

<p>

[spirits] can perform intellectual work. they can answer 
questions. they can affect the world by disbursing gold at 
the [vault] or by controlling a [magic arm] in a [factory].

</p>

<p>

even small [errors] in [spells] can have complex and 
unanticipated [consequences]. a small bug in a spell can lead 
to the catastrophic crash of an [airship] or the 
self-destruction of an [industrial golem].
