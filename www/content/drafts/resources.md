even a few old 16-bit computers would be enough to get started


3 ways of getting resources for the badlands:

1. exhaust stream of the city
2. steal/win hardware as part of a challenge inside the city
3. use a fabricator


stuff in the city is created by the staff
stuff in the slums is created by users
you can go to the city once you have a vehicle


power supply, power demand, and energy storage


resource
transportation


wind maps

sunlight maps

copper/optic maps

subnet/ring maps


Cables
Satellite
Point to Point antenna
Mobile

public switched telephone network.


Once the power goes out, most telephone exchanges have about 2-6 hours of battery power. Then generators kick in that will last normally 1-2 days. (The assumption is that a service tech should come along to refuel the generators before they run out.)

In many places the generators have to be manually started.

Cell phone towers have similar back power systems



Only those with access to solar, wind, and turbine energy would be able to power their computers in order to log on.

cell tower

Ad hoc wireless networks


Wired
Salvage some cable (every destroyed building is filled with it) and you can put together a network 100 meters at a time very easily
start with a basic 100 Meg. network and you can extend it around town using every switch and router you find.

WiFi
Get a few salvaged access points running and you're all set

Fiber
unless you can find a good cache of cable and top-quality tools, fiber will take longer to get online than copper

Cellular and other long-range wireless

powering the internet will be a lower priority than powering lighting, machinery in factories and many other things


input/output is measured and throttled 
cpu usage is used to measure power consumption
battery depletion is determined from power consumption over time
