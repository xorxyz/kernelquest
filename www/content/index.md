You are a computer process without a master. You explore virtual machines and interact with their components. Schedulers give you missions in the form of computer security puzzles. Completing missions reward you with extra CPU time and virtual memory. Use the shell's built-in language to extend your binary's functions and discover the secrets of the virtual land of Xor.
