  <p>
    i wrote the first version of the interpreter during the weekend. i hooked it on to the input element in the "play" page, so you can start playing with it. it doesn't interface with the game system yet, but that part should be relatively trivial.

  <p>
    the <code>xor shell</code> is a joy-like language. it's concatenative and functional. every function is unary, taking a stack as the only argument and returning a stack as the result. </p>

  <p>
    there's pratically no syntax. the space between atoms denotes function composition. arguments always precede the function. you can build lists by putting words inside square brackets (<code>`[` and `]`</code>). lists and programs are the same thing. you can pass around programs just like you can pass around lists.

    <code>please</code> takes a program as an input and returns a continuation of the programâ€™s result, as interpreted by the other agent.

  <p>
    <code>lookat</code> takes a reference to a thing as an input and resolves to the local representation of that thing. <code>whatis</code> takes a representation of a thing as an input and returns the thingâ€™s type. <code>count</code> takes a type and returns the number of local instances of that type.

  <p>i canâ€™t wait for this to not be so cryptic anymore ðŸ˜‚</p>
