# principles

these ideas should be embodied by the game mechanics, or taught through quests, or implied through the narrative:

1. The complexity of attacked programs works in favor of the attacker
2. Given enough time for the preparation of an exploit, nonexploitability is the exception, not the rule
3. Humans aren't good at handling complexity

trust

hacking 
the capability & skill set to expose and verify
trust (security, control) assumptions
expressed in software, hardware, and
human-in-the-loop processes that use them

working towards computer systems
we can finally trust

Computer system behaves as expected =
only expected kinds of computations
occur

complexity, composition, computation

Finding reliable mechanisms for
unexpected computations
programming with unintended automata & Turing machines
inside the target
