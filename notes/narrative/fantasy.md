fantasy
recovery
escape
consolation

faerie

an enchanted realm

a world which is consistent and rational, under rules other than those of the normal world

presented as wholly credible

the interdependence of language and human consciousness
an alternative world or universe as the setting for speculative fiction

marvels
cannot tolerate any frame or machinery suggesting that the whole framework in which they occur is a figment or illusion

fantasy allows one to review their own world from the "perspective" of a different world

one's unquestioned assumptions might be recovered and changed by an outside perspective
