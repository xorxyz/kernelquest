# battles

players battle monsters by casting spells, throwing projectiles 
or using traps.

farmers (tank)
  barely have any spells, 
  and they're just a bit slow
  but they can take a lot of damage
  and have a reliable melee attack

healers
  have healing spells and enchantments (buffs)
  can cure detrimental effects
  and they can take a lot of damage

wizards (nuker) ranged dps
  have spells of all sorts
  frail in melee combat, 
  but can rain down death from afar

scout (rogue) melee dps
  have spells that make them nimble
  and they're difficult to hit
  but they can't take a lot of damage
