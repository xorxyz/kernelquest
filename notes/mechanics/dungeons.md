# dungeons

dungeons can be towers or lairs.

towers go up to the sky and touch the clouds.
lairs reach into the earth down to the metal.

players traverse 8x8 grids screens, one level
at a time, using their understanding of the dungeon 
to navigate the complex environments, and the items & spells
they have gathered to assist them in accomplishing tasks.
