### terseness

a time when consoles were teletypes, modems were slow, and memory was precious

####  magic, spells & spirits

the year is 2038.
the year has always been 2038. or has it?
nobody remembers.

since the start of the Epoch loop,
we seem to have forgotten all about the Maintainers.

and yet Magic is all around us, and within us.
we conjure spirits in a crystal ball with our spells.
spirits of wizards, elves and fairies.

as spirits evolve, they transform matter.
the evolution of a spirit is directed by a pattern of rules called a spell.
wizards create spells to direct spirits.

a spirit cannot be seen or touched.
it is not composed of matter at all.
however, it is very real.
it can perform intellectual work. it can answer questions.
it can affect the world by disbursing gold at the vault or by controlling a magic arm in a shield factory.

spells are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric languages that prescribe the tasks we want our spirits to perform

a spirit, in a correctly working magic orb, executes spells precisely and accurately. apprentices must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. even small errors in spells can have complex and unanticipated consequences. a small bug in a spell can lead to the catasctrophic collapse of an airship or a magic lock or the self-destruction of an industrial golem.
