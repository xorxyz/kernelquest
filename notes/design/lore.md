what is the [Epoch] loop, anyway?

---

the year is [2038].
the year has always been 2038. or has it?
nobody remembers.

---

people seem to have mostly forgotten about the [Maintainers].

---

the evolution of a spirit is directed by a pattern of rules called a [spell].

---

[spells] are carefully composed from [symbolic] expressions in arcane and [esoteric] languages. they prescribe the tasks one wants [spirits] to perform.

---

a [spirit] cannot be seen or touched.
it is not composed of matter at all.
however, it is very [real].

---

as [spirits] evolve, they transform matter.

---

[spirits] can perform intellectual work. they can answer questions.
they can affect the world by disbursing gold at the [vault] or by controlling a [magic arm] in a [factory].

---

[apprentices] learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their [conjuring]. 

---

even small [errors] in [spells] can have complex and unanticipated [consequences]. a small bug in a spell can lead to the catastrophic crash of an [airship] or the self-destruction of an [industrial golem].
