# design of the language

> "one of these Joy inspired languages"

- literals of any type cause a value of that type to be pushed onto the stack
- lists are just special cases of quoted programs
- a function can consume any number of parameters from the stack and leave any number of results on the stack

# data types

```
domain == 1 or more shards
shard  == 64 zones
zone   == 32 rooms
room   == 16 rows x 10 cols
col    == 10 cells
row    == 16 cells
cell   == 2 bytes
char   == 1 byte
```

1. simple: 
  1. boolean: 00 01
  2. integers: 00 01 03 1F FF (0-255)
  3. chars: ðŸ§™  (2 bytes)
  2. floating point: 1.2, 1.23, 6.5e3, 23.1e-1 
  2. characters: 'a 'A
2. aggregate:
  1. lists, or quoted programs: []
  2. strings: "hello world"
  3. sets: { 1 2 3 }

- self-interpreted
- introspection, reflection and metaprogramming
