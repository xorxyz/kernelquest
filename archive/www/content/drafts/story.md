The year is 2038, and we have reached the end of Unix time.

Specialized machines are used to interface with the subconscious when the body goes to sleep. This allows exploration of dreams and the mind by means of computers.

In this realm of thought and dream, visitors travel as disembodied souls. "It is [a great, silvery sea, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars](https://almonte.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Plane)". 

Adventurers have started exploring this strange plane at the junction of Cyberspace and "Dream space".

Who knows what secrets this new dimension holds?
